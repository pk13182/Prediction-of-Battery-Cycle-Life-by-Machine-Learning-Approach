## Recent Work

- Conducted a comprehensive review of lithium-ion battery degradation mechanisms, focusing on electrochemical ageing, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, and capacity fade pathways.
- Analysed cycling data from 124 commercial lithium iron phosphate cells (MIT dataset), including voltage, current, temperature, and capacity profiles collected under controlled conditions.

## Future Work

- Implement linear regression with elastic net regularization for battery capacity fade prediction.
- Apply Random Forest and other machine learning models to increase predictive performance.
- Compare and benchmark different algorithms to identify the best predictive approach.
- Enhance feature engineering and data processing strategies for model improvement.
